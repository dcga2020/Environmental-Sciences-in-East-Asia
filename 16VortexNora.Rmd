## What is Land Use Change?

## What Factors Drive Land Use Change?

## How Land Use Change is Measured and Quantified

### Integration of sociology

### with data science: spatial data compiled from aerial photos, Landsat satellite images, topographic maps, GPS data, etc.

### Requires classification and division of land-space types

## Ecological Effects of Land Use Change on Soil, Air, and Water

### Impacts on Soil

### Deforestation and soil degradation

#### lack of stability (erosion) and loss of carbon sequestration potential

### Forests


### coupled with monoculture agriculture

#### Example Case Study: representative of monoculture agriculture-rice paddies in SE Asia (potentiallyâ€¦)


### Impacts on Local Watersheds

#### hydrology 

infiltration/pollution, groundwater recharge, flow of river basins, runoff

#### Higher risk of flooding and droughts

# Conclusion & Prospect of Sustainable Urbanization/Land Use Change
