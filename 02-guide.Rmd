## Revision History and Process

### Publication Dates

I will regularly push and publish the results of the text based on submissions. 



### Using R Markdown

In the past, I used \LaTeX to make publication quality text, but because we will to make this into a on-line resource, creating HTML code is a better option. 

R Markdown is a relatively simple language to use and will allow us to integrate text and data science into the web text. 

I have provided some basic resources for R Markdown, but there are numerous electronic resources available for free that can also be consulted.

- [R Studio Tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
- [R Studio's Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf?_ga=2.107420162.161662097.1613074083-214354297.1613074083)

### Using R to Create Figures

R Markdown can be a very powerful tool to integrate R code, figures and text. Making high quality figures that are both clear and aestically pleasing will be something that we need to think about it. 

- Axis Labels -- 
- Axis Text -- Size, Orientation 
- Captions (usually better than titles)
- References connecting labels to references
- ADA accessible (e.g. color impairment mitigation)

```{r, label=updatedata, echo=TRUE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
address <- "ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt"
download.file(address, "maunaloa", quiet = F, mode = "w", cacheOK = T)

maunaloa <- read.table("maunaloa", skip=70)
names(maunaloa) <- c("year", "month", "decimal.date", "average", "interpolated", "trend", "days")
maunaloa$average[maunaloa$average==-99.99] <- NA
maunaloa <- data.frame(year=maunaloa$year, month=maunaloa$month, decimal.date=maunaloa$decimal.date, average=maunaloa$average)
head(maunaloa)
str(maunaloa)
write.csv(maunaloa, file = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Environmnental-Sciences-in-East-Asia/data/maunaloa.csv", eol = "\n", row.names = F)
```

```{r, label=analyzingdata, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
maunaloa = read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Environmnental-Sciences-in-East-Asia/data/maunaloa.csv")
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(mgcv)

# Split the data into training and test set
set.seed(123)
training.samples <- maunaloa$average %>%
  createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train.data  <- maunaloa[training.samples, ]
test.data <- maunaloa[-training.samples, ]
future.data = max(maunaloa$decimal.date)+1:36/12

# Build the model
model <- gam(average ~ s(decimal.date), data = maunaloa)
summary(model)
# Make predictions
predictions <- model %>% predict(test.data)
# Model performance
data.frame(
  RMSE = RMSE(predictions, test.data$average),
  R2 = R2(predictions, test.data$average)
)
```

In the case of Figure \@ref(maunaloa), we can a create a figure that has all of the characteristics listed above, except perhaps ADA. Creating a "alt text" for the figure is something we might want to consider. 

```{r, label=maunaloa, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Carbon Dioxide Measure on Mauna Loa, HI'}
theme_set(theme_classic())
ggplot(train.data, aes(decimal.date, average) ) + 
#  stat_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE), fullrange=T) +
  geom_line() + xlab("Year") + ylab("Carbon Dioxide (ppm)") +
  stat_smooth(method = gam, formula = y ~ s(x), color = "red") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size=14), 
          axis.title=element_text(size=14))

```
