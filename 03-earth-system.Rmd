# The Earth System

## The Sun's Energy and the Earth's Temperature

The temperture of the Earth's surface is the result of a balance -- the energy entering the atmosphere and the leaving the atmosphere. Most of this energy is in the form of light or electromagnetic radiation. 

Light enters the atmosphere, where some is absorbed and some is reflected. The the ``quality'' of light changes through these processes. 

### The Spectrum of Light Entering and Exiting the Earth's Surface

As the sun's electromagnetic radiation interacts with the Earth's Atmosphere, certain wavelengths are absorbed and filtered out \@ref(fig:em_entering).


```{r em_entering, fig.align = 'full', out.width = "150%", fig.cap = "Various wavelengths of solar electromagnetic radiation penetrate Earth's atmosphere to various depths. Fortunately for us, all of the high energy X-rays and most UV is filtered out long before it reaches the ground. Much of the infrared radiation is also absorbed by our atmosphere far above our heads. Most radio waves do make it to the ground, along with a narrow `window' of IR, UV, and visible light frequencies. Credit: Image courtesy STCI/JHU/NASA."}

### Long and Short Time Scales

The carbon cycle processes occur at wide range of temporal scales from hundreds of millions of years to seasons of the year. These have been referred to as long and short carbon cycles. However, for our purposes, I will call them ``geologic carbon'' and ''biosphere carbon'' processes.
